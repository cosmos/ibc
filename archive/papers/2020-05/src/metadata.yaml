  The interblockchain communication protocol (IBC) is an end-to-end, connection-oriented, stateful protocol for reliable, ordered, and authenticated communication between modules on separate distributed ledgers.
  IBC is designed for interoperation between heterogeneous ledgers arranged in an unknown, dynamic topology, operating with varied consensus algorithms and state machines. The protocol realises this by specifying
  the sufficient set of data structures, abstractions, and semantics of a communication protocol which once implemented by participating ledgers will allow them to safely communicate. IBC is payload-agnostic
  and provides a cross-ledger asynchronous communication primitive which can be used as a constituent building block by a wide variety of applications.
